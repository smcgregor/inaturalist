This site combines common web technologies to provide a fun and efficient way to record, find, and share the best and worst water practices. It also provides forums and community spaces for water enthusiasts to interact and meet others with similar interests. Through fostering these observations and communities, we hope to encourage greater environmental awareness.

We Hope You Share Your World With Us,<br />
